	<h1>Why I want to become a developer?</h1>
	<p> Becoming a software developer has been a lifelong aspiration fueled by my passion for problem-solving, creativity,
        and the boundless potential of technology. From a young age, I found myself intrigued by the power of computers
        to transform ideas into reality, and I have nurtured this fascination into a burning desire to contribute to the
        ever-evolving world of software.</p>
